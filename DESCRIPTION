Description: The Group-Specific Structural Topic Model (gSTM) extends the 
  Structural Topic Model to allow researchers to estimate topic models 
  with document-level and group-specific covariates. The package includes 
  tools for model selection, visualization, and estimation of topic-covariate 
  regressions, which are particularly useful for studying structured 
  document collections where group dynamics are of interest.
